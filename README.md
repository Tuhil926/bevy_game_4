# How to play

- first, you are in a menu screen. It's currently blank, so you can press 'g' to enter the game state.
- here, you can press 'esc' to pause, or 'm' to go back to menu(which also saves the game).
- you can press the number keys to navigate to different inventory slots.
- you can press right click to place a block, and hold left click on a block to break it.
- you can punch trees and rocks by holding down left click while facing towards them and being close enough.

Currently, there is no way to obtain anything other than stone and wood, so if you want more of the other stuff, you can edit the assets folder, players.txt and give yourself more stuff.
